#Blog thesea re some simple commands to get the server and web app running !

```console
$ rm -rf .git .canvas
```

The `rm` command removes files from your computer's memory. The `-r` flag tells
the console to remove _recursively_, which allows the command to remove
directories and the files within them. `-f` removes them permanently.

`.git` contains this directory's configuration to track changes and push to
Github (you want to track and push _your own_ changes instead), and `.canvas`
contains the metadata to create a Canvas page from your Git repo. You don't have
the permissions to edit our Canvas course, so it's not worth keeping around.

### Creating Your Own Git Repo

First things first- rename this directory! Once you have an idea for a name,
move one level up with `cd ..` and run
`mv python-p4-project-template <new-directory-name>` to change its name (replace
<new-directory-name> with an appropriate project directory name).

> **Note: If you typed the `mv` command in a terminal within VS Code, you should
> close VS Code then reopen it.**

> **Note: `mv` actually stands for "move", but your computer interprets this
> rename as a move from a directory with the old name to a directory with a new
> name.**

`cd` back into your new directory and run `git init` to create a local git
repository. Add all of your local files to version control with `git add --all`,
then commit them with `git commit -m'initial commit'`. (You can change the
message here- this one is just a common choice.)



## Setup

### `server/`

The `server/` directory contains all of your backend code.



To download the dependencies for the backend server, run:

```console
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

You can run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by
running:

```console
python server/app.py
```

Check that your server serves the default route `http://localhost:5555`. You
should see a web page with the heading "Project Server".

### `client/`

The `client/` directory contains all of your frontend code. The file
`package.json` has been configured with common React application dependencies,
include `react-router-dom`. The file also sets the `proxy` field to forward
requests to `"http://localhost:5555". Feel free to change this to another port-
just remember to configure your Flask app to use another port as well!

To download the dependencies for the frontend client, run:

```console
npm install --prefix client
```

You can run your React app on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) by
running:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```

Check that your the React client displays a default page
`http://localhost:3000`. You should see a web page with the heading "Project
Client".

## Generating Your Database

NOTE: The initial project directory structure does not contain the `instance` or
`migrations` folders. Change into the `server` directory:

```console
cd server
```

Then enter the commands to create the `instance` and `migrations` folders and
the database `app.db` file:

```
flask db init
flask db upgrade head
```


```py
# Standard library imports

# Remote library imports
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from flask_restful import Api
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import MetaData

# Local imports

# Instantiate app, set attributes
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.json.compact = False

# Define metadata, instantiate db
metadata = MetaData(naming_convention={
    "fk": "fk_%(table_name)s_%(column_0_name)s_%(referred_table_name)s",
})
db = SQLAlchemy(metadata=metadata)
migrate = Migrate(app, db)
db.init_app(app)

# Instantiate REST API
api = Api(app)

# Instantiate CORS
CORS(app)

```



```py
CORS(app)
```

By default, Flask-CORS enables CORS on all routes in your application with all
fetching servers. You can also specify the resources that allow CORS. The
following specifies that routes beginning with `api/` allow CORS from any
originating server:


CORS(app, resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": "*"}})
